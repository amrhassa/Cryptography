    <p><span style="color: #FF4F0A;font-size: 1.1em;text-decoration: underline">Cryptography</span> is a method of protecting information and communication through the use of codes, so it can be read and processed only by those for whom the information is intended. The "crypt-" prefix means "hidden" or "vault" â€” and the "-graphy" suffix stands for "writing."In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts, and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, transforming messages in hard-to-decipher ways. These deterministic algorithms are used for key generation cryptography, digital signing, data privacy protection verification, internet web browsing, and confidential communications such as credit card transactions and e-mail.</p>

    <p><span style="color: #FF4F0A;font-size: 1.1em;text-decoration: underline">Cryptography</span> is closely related to the disciplines of cryptology and cryptanalysis. It includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. In today's computer-centric world, however, cryptography is most frequently associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Persons practicing this field are known as cryptographers.
    <br>Modern cryptography concerns itself with the following four objectives:<br>
    <ul>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">Confidentiality: </span>Anyone for whom it was unintended can not understand the information </li><br>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">Integrity: </span>The information can not be changed in storage or transit between the sender and the intended receiver without detecting the alteration </li><br>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">Non-repudiation: </span>the creator / sender of the information can not deny his / her intentions in the creation or transmission of the information at a later stage </li> <br>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">Authentication: </span>The sender and recipient can confirm the identity of each other and the origin / destination of the information</li><br>
  
  </ul>
        Procedures and protocols are known as cryptosystems which meet some or all of the above criteria. Cryptosystems are often thought to refer only to mathematical procedures and computer programs; however, they also include regulating human behavior, such as selecting hard to guess passwords, logging out unused systems, and not discussing sensitive procedures with outsiders.

    <p><span style="color: #FF4F0A;font-size: 1.1em">Cryptosystems</span>  use a set of processes known as cryptographic algorithms, or ciphers, to encrypt and decrypt messages to secure communication between computer systems, devices such as smartphones, and apps. A cipher suite uses one encryption algorithm, another message authentication algorithm and one key exchange algorithm. Embedded in protocols and written in software running on operating systems and networked computer systems, this process involves the generation of public and private key for data encryption / decryption, digital signing and verification for message authentication, and key exchange.</p>

    <p> Single-key or symmetric-key encryption algorithms create a fixed length of bits known as a block cipher with a secret key that the creator / sender uses to encipher data (encryption) and the receiver uses to decipher it. Types of symmetric-key cryptography include the Advanced Encryption Standard ( AES), a specification established in November 2001 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as a Federal Information Processing Standard ( FIPS 197), to protect sensitive information. The standard is mandated by the government of the United States and widely used in the private sector.<br><br>
    AES was approved for classified information by the US government in June 2003. It is a royalty-free specification which is implemented worldwide in software and hardware. AES is the successor to the Standard for Data Encryption (DES) and DES3. To prevent brute force and other attacks it uses longer key lengths (128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit).<br><br>
    Public-key or asymmetric-key encryption algorithms use a pair of keys, a public key linked to the creator / sender to encrypt messages, and a private key known only to the originator (unless it is exposed or they decide to share it) to decrypt that information. The types of public-key cryptography include RSA, widely used on the internet; Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used by Bitcoin; Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) adopted by NIST in FIPS 186-4 as a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures; and Diffie-Hellman key exchanges.<br><br>
    To maintain data integrity in cryptography, hash functions, which return a deterministic output from an input value, are used to map data to a fixed data size. Types of cryptographic hash functions include SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1), SHA-2 and SHA-3.

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Attackers can bypass cryptography, hack into computers responsible for data encryption and decryption and exploit weak implementations, such as the use of default keys. Cryptography however makes it more difficult for attackers to access messages and data that are protected by encryption algorithms.<br>
    Growing concerns over the processing power of quantum computing to break current standards for cryptography encryption led the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST) to call for new public key cryptography standards in 2016 for papers among the mathematical and scientific community. Quantum computing, unlike today's computer systems, uses quantity bits (qubits), which can represent both 0s and 1s, and therefore perform two calculations at once. While a large-scale quantum computer may not be built in the next decade, according to NIST, the existing infrastructure requires standardization of publicly known and understood algorithms which provide a secure approach.The deadline for submissions was in November 2017, it is expected to take three to five years to analyze the proposals.

    <p>The word "cryptography," meaning hidden, is derived from the Greek kryptos. The origin of the cryptography is usually dated with the Egyptian hieroglyphics practice from about 2000 B.C. These consisted of complex pictograms whose full meaning was known only to few of the elite. Julius Caesar (100 B.C. to 44 B.C.), who did not trust his messengers when communicating with his governors and officers, was the first known usage of a modern cipher. For this reason he created a system in which the Roman alphabet replaced each character in his messages with a character three positions ahead of it.<br><br>Recently cryptography has become a battleground of some of the best mathematicians and computer scientists in the world. The ability to store and transfer sensitive information in a secure manner has proven a critical factor in war and business success.<br><br>Since governments do not want certain entities in and out of their countries to have access to ways of receiving and sending hidden information that could pose a threat to national interests, cryptography has been subject to different restrictions in many countries , ranging from restrictions on the use and export of software to the public dissemination of mathematical concepts that could be used to develo But the internet has allowed the spread of powerful programs and, more importantly, the underlying cryptographic techniques, so that many of today's most advanced cryptosystems and ideas are now in the public domain.

      <h1>Cryptography Tools</h1>
     </div>  
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p><span style="color: #FF4F0A;font-size: 1.1em">Cryptography</span> tools are more useful in the situations of signature confirmation, code signing and to perform other cryptography activities. Here are the extensively used cryptography tools.
      <ol>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">Security Token</span><br>This token is used for user verification. To execute a protected exchange of information, a security token must be encrypted. Also, the HTTP protocol provides complete statefulness. So, a browser uses the server-side formulated token to go on with the state. In general, remote authentication is the method that moves. </li><br>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">JCA </span><br>That is the tool used to authorize the process of encryption. This tool could be called Cryptographic Java libraries. These Java libraries are included with predefined activities where prior to implementation they need to be imported. Despite being the Java library, it works in proportion to other frameworks and thus supports multiple application development.
    </li><br>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">SignTool.exe</span><br>
    This is Microsoft's popular tool mostly used to sign the files. The prominent feature supported by this tool is the addition of a signature and time stamp to any kind of file. This holds the ability to authenticate the file with the time mark in the file. The entire functionality in SignTool.exe ensures increased file reliability.</li> <br>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">Docker </span><br>One can build huge applications using the docker. The information kept in the docker is entirely in encrypted format. Cryptography must be strictly followed in this, in order to move with data encryption. In addition, both files and information are encrypted, so that no one can access the things that do not have an exact access key. Docker is also envisaged as a cloud storage that allows users to manage the information on a dedicated or shared server.
    </li><br>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">CertMgr.exe</span><br>
    This is the file to install as it is in the.exe-extension format. CertMgr holds good handling of different certificates. In addition, it even handles CRLs where those are lists for the revocation of certificates. The aim of cryptography in the development of certificates is to ensure that the information exchanged between the parties is more protected and this tool supports the addition of additional bits in protection.
    </li><br>
    <li><span style="color: #63bee8;font-size: 1.2em;text-decoration: underline">Authentication Using Key</span><br>
    Here, the encrypted information needs to be decrypted via keys. Everyone can easily understand the normal information whereas the encrypted information is known only to the intended user. There are two types of encryption techniques in this tool and these are:<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #A4A5A5;font-size: 0.9em">CSymmetric Key Cryptography</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #A4A5A5;font-size: 0.9em">Asymmetric Key Cryptography</span></li></li>
  </ul>
    So, cryptography tools are mostly used in every secured activity and there are many tools available where users can choose the one depending on their necessities.
